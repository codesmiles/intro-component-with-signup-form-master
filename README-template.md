## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML(few inputs)
- CSS(some flexbox)
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Well I was able to grab a hold on how to to style descendants of a tag which was awesome, tho i took a lot of time to work towards due to my gitters towards DOM manipulations and Javascript integrations but I know >"Day by day in every way i get better and better"

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

The use of arrow function in Javascript section is a little bit new for me so i have to get familiar with it, also my code might seem bulky but with the right practice i think it'll get better hopefully, as long as I keep working on my self i think I will be better than who i was yesterday.
